Stergiou et al. 2011 contract two approaches to explore movement variability
i) conventional statistical tools like standard deviation
describe a value of magnitude variability from a central point
that are measurements of centrality. that not consider the dependency between events
ii) nonlinear dynamics that explore the variation of how motor behaviour emerge
