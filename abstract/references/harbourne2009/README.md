Authors include three defitions of variablity
(behavioral varialbity, webster's dictionary and statistical varialilty)
that each one contribute to the undesrtanding of vailrabyt
Also they present simple sintetical signals and many clinical example of how
the quantification of variability with nonlinear dynamic tools is benefited.
They raised a very intersting point about the distinshion between the amount
and structure of variablity and present three references [37 to 39]
where researchers in control gait found that
"as measuraments of the amount of variablity increased,
measuremetns of the structure or organisation of variablity decresed."
Such distinction between amount and structure of variability is a very
interesting area for further exploration in my current experiments of
human-robot imitation activities.
The paper conclude with some advices of how nonlinear tools can be used
for the quantification of skillfullness or the area of motor skill research.

Similarly, they presented some limitation of nonlinear measures which
open further areas of reaserch such as the embedding of nonlinera algorithms
in the sensors to help physical theraphis to compute such nonlinear algorithms
and the data sets with suffient length and good quality. However such limitations
posed in 2009 might already be covered today (December 2017).
