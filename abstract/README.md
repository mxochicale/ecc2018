## Abstract
The organization wants to limit the size of abstracts, so you must enter the content of it in the following text field.

Limited to 500 words. 500 remaining words

Movement variability is defined as the variations that occur in motor
performance across multiple repetitions of a task and such behaviour is an
inherent feature within and between each persons' movement \cite{tlockhart2013}.
In the previous three decades, research on measurement and understanding of
movement variability with methodologies of nonlinear dynamics has been well established
in areas such as biomechanics, sport science, psychology, cognitive science,
neuroscience and robotics \cite{stergiou2011,harbourne2009}.
To quantify movement variability, we therefore consider a methodology from nonlinear dynamics
called uniform reconstructed state space where essentially dynamics of
an unknown system can be reconstructed using one dimensional time series.
As pointed out by Bradley et al. \cite{bradley2015} uniform reconstructed state space,
if done right, can guarantee to be topologically identical to the true dynamics
and determine dynamics invariants such as fractal dimension, Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy or Lyaponov exponents.
These algorithms, however, require time series measured with costly sensors
that provide well sampled data with little noise.
Such requirement is generally a common problem when doing precise
characterisation of time series using dynamic invariants,
to which Bradley et al. \cite{bradley2015} proposed additional tools of
nonlinear time series analysis for practitioners such as surrogate data,
permutation entropy, recurrence plots and network characteristics for time series.
For this study, we are interested in the use of uniform reconstructed
state space and the analysis of recurrence plots so as to understand
the quantification of movement variability.
Particularly, we are interested in the analysis of data collected through
cheap wearable inertial sensors and its effects on the
reconstructed state space and the recurrence plots
for different lengths and preprocessing techniques
(like smoothing and normalisation) of the time series.
So, here we show the characterisation of human movement variability in the
context of human-humanoid imitation activities.
Specifically, we explore the reconstruction of state spaces and its recurrence plots for
20 participants performing repetitions of simple vertical and horizontal arm
movements in normal and faster velocity.
We also explore the differences between wearable inertial sensors attached
to the person and to the humanoid robot and between different axes of inertial sensors.
With that in mind, our contribution to knowledge is in regard to the
reliability of data from cheap wearable inertial sensors
to analyse human movement variability in the context of human-humanoid imitation activities
using methodologies of nonlinear dynamics.
Such understanding and measurement of movement variability using
cheap wearable inertial sensors lead us to have a more intuitive selection of parameters
to reconstruct the state spaces and to create meaningful interpretations
of the recurrence plots. Additionally, having a better understanding of
nonlinear dynamics tools with the use of cheap inertial sensors
can enhance the development of better diagnostic tools for various pathologies which
can be applied in areas of rehabilitation, entertainment or sport science \cite{tlockhart2013}.
