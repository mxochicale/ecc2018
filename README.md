The 15th Experimental Chaos and Complexity Conference 2018 (ECCC2018) - [Website](https://eventos.urjc.es/9662/detail/the-15th-experimental-chaos-and-complexity-conference.html)

This biennial conference is dedicated to experimental work in nonlinear
dynamics. It is a highly interdisciplinary conference to highlight experiments
and experimental challenges, although the conference attracts many theorists
and mathematicians providing a theoretical framework to observations or
new methods for analyzing data.

If you would like to share with the community your recent experimental
findings (or you are a theoretician looking for an experiment) about
nonlinear dynamics on:

* brain & neurons
* optics & lasers
* electronic networks
* social science and transportation systems
* data science, machine learning and cyber security
* granular media and active matter
* climate and earth
* fluids & plasma
* ecological systems and evolution
* experimental game theory
* systems biology
* cardiac waves and tumor growth
* chemical systems

or any other topic related with the general scope of the conference,
the organizing committee encourages your participation.

# Abstract submission

Click in the following [link](https://eventos.urjc.es/login/index/9662.html?redirect_to=@9662@upload@the-15th-experimental-chaos-and-complexity-conference.html) to submit (or modifiy) an abstract. You will be asked to create a new account or to log in to an existing one.

Please, follow these instructions to prepare your abstract:

1. Abstracts should contain less than 500 words and be written in
    PLAIN TEXT without any style or template.
2. Equations can be included using LaTeX syntax:
```
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
E=mc^2
\end{equation}
```
and refer to the equation using Eq.~\ref{eq1}.
3. Special symbols in the abstract should be edited in LaTeX syntax.

4. References can be added into the abstract:
   Use the LaTeX citation command \cite{key} and add at
   the end of the abstract:
```
\begin{thebibliography}{10}
\bibitem{key}
F. Alonso, R. Nadal, {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 108} 123456 (2012)
