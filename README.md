The 15th Experimental Chaos and Complexity Conference 2018 (ECCC2018)

This biennial conference is dedicated to experimental work in nonlinear
dynamics. It is a highly interdisciplinary conference to highlight experiments
and experimental challenges, although the conference attracts many theorists
and mathematicians providing a theoretical framework to observations or
new methods for analyzing data.

If you would like to share with the community your recent experimental
findings (or you are a theoretician looking for an experiment) about
nonlinear dynamics on: brain & neurons, optics & lasers, electronic networks,
social science and transportation systems, data science, machine learning and cyber security,
granular media and active matter, climate and earth,  fluids & plasma, 
ecological systems and evolution, experimental game theory, 
systems biology, cardiac waves and tumor growth,  chemical systems,
or any other topic related with the general scope of the conference,
the organizing committee encourages your participation.
