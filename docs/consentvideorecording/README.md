​​Dear ECC15 speaker,

I am contacting you regarding the option we have given to record your talk. In order to do that we need you to return by email the attached consent form signed in case you agree to be recorded. 

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Best regards and see you soon.

Irene Sendiña-Nadal
