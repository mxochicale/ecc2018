"Measure everything has become a mania" 
that's what I learnt from "LA CIENCIA DEL CAOS (I. Schifter, 2001)" in Mexico ten years ago,
that, in a way, has lead me to the 15th Experimental Chaos and Complexity Conference (@ecc15madrid2018)
where I am going to give a talk about: 
"Quantifying the Inherent Chaos of Human Movement Variability"
