* Testing jerking on movement variability!
Which reminds me the work of Hikori Mori:
"Understanding human fetal development (Jerk=d^3x/dt^3). 
An whole body musculoskeletal system simulation with low level nervous system in the first half of a pregnant" 
https://www.lucs.lu.se/LUCS/149/yamada.pdf



* The problem of selecting  different values of embedding parameters 
when every time series come from different participant 
which inherently moves differently to any of the other participants.
How can the values for embedding parameters can be normalised
to capture the nature of variability between all participants.



* Applications for patients with Cerebral Palsy where 
evident variability of movement can be identified.
For which more research has to be done in that venue
to explore how measuring variability with any motor 
skill can be quantified.

Here are a couple of papers that may interest you â€” a couple on movement and a couple about recurrence plots.  I have doubts about RQA as well.

Also, you should be careful with the nonlinear time-series analysis stuff, since you have some nonstationarity in your data.

Miguel, you really should get a hold of Holger's book:  https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Time-Analysis-Holger-Kantz/dp/0521529026

It's a much more detailed primer on how to do nonlinear time series analysis.
