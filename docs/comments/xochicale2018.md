# Introduction

These are some comments about interesting talks/people/ideas
and some of my experiences at the ECCC 2018.

# 4 June 2018 (Monday)

kicked off 
150 attnedes from 20 countries, with 18 invited speakers,
41 contributed talks, and 60 posters.

ken

 then to his explanaiton about 
profesors with unihemispheric sleep of mammals
such as dolphins, seals, whales, sea lions, and many
types of birds

* oliver
overwhelmed about the whole new sea in insects and other
nature-inspired chaotic systems


* ken and flavio work with Chimera which I havent heard it
before,  but according to wikipedia is an impossible
 being or thing made up of incongrious parts,
and the works of Chimera states for couple oscillators 
(Abrams et al. 2004),
where Flavio H. Felton is also contributins
among his work with GPU to solve millions of differential
equations in low computational power devices like mobile 
phones

* i was also very surprised about the work on bells
by ts
 and the interseting work of stoop, who is a physicis,
working on understanding of mamalian cochlea

* big data vs small data personalised medicine.
(Grey, J. M. 2013) the shift to personlised and population medicine 
(Estrin, D 2014) small data where n = me. 
(Schork, N. J et al. 2015) Personalised medicine: time for one-person trials.


* The magic dust of AI and how cyberattackers migth be benefit
from opensource datasets and open source code.

* Multilayered networks-of-networks (Adaptive multiscales)

* ulrike with his theoretical work with harmful alga blooms (HABs)
and his collaboration with other areas and reasearchers 
> Modeling <> Experiments <> Time Series Analysis(Holger Kantz) <

Last but not least, the  the talsk about rasberry py and recurrent nerual ntworsk (),
very cheap experimental work of (last speaker)
how to model timeseris wtih symbolization (coolaboration with colombian, brazillina and spanish scientist)





# 5 June 2018 (Tuesday)

POSTER

* (p38, p40) Very instering talks at the posters sessions
where I met Merten Stender prensing his work:
"Multiple Scales in complex friction-induced disk brake vibrations"
it is interesting how they are fusion sensor information 
from a microphone, data accelerometers. I like the aim 
of the work to have better understading of hte excitation
mechanisms and component intearction udring operations.
Based on Stender's comments, for their work, they
only analyse data from 3 doctors to which the are lots
of opportunity to have a better understadngin on how
other docotos perform the same activity.
Also Stender is using Brunton et al 2016 work
to create differential equations and how they affect 
to different parameters for which he also use 
recurrence plots. 
i also learnt that rp can be performed using only
a number of neanerst nearightoburs which also 
might be sensitibie according to tiem series.

* (p53)
 The constructive talk about the work of Hiromichi Suetani et al
of using 
the t- distributed stochastic  neighbourd embedding
for identifiing variablity of 100 patients 
of 64 channesl of EEG signals.
"Maniford learning of ordinal pattern dirsgritubions for identification
of indifivuallity of human brain dynamics using EEG signals at rest"

* (p33) Ignacio Echegoyen is owrking with fifferten methods
to measure syncronistaion such as specetal coherence, mutual information,
phacese locking value and person correlation which basically
each of them are sensitistive for window length varations.

* (p17) I met Christophe Letellier who clarifies that the fortran code 
was written by Cao L. and his suggestios about the use of Poincare SEctions
using RQAs because.

TALKS

* Very exiting talks of jumping and dancing drops and the quantum effects
by John Bush and Pedro J. Saenz (very nice videos  :) ).

* "active matter" and kolmogorovian active turbulence by Mickael Bourgoin

* roman grigoriev and his work on dynamics, geometry, and topoloy
of fluid turbunlence.

* jordy tiana-alsina and the use of rocs 

* domenico lippolis in china doing theorical/experimental quantum mechanics
and his particular way to do his presentation from a a latex document

* saliya coulibaly introduce me the lyapunov spectrum

The introduction should introduce the original paper and put it in context
(e.g. is it an important paper in the domain ?). You must also specify if there
was an implementation available somewhere and provide a link to it if relevant
(and in such a case, you have to specify if the proposed replication is based
on this original implementation). You should also introduce your implementation
by listing language, tools, libraries, etc. and motivate choices if relevant.

# Methods

The methods section should explain how you replicated the original results:

* did you use paper description
* did you contact authors ?
* did you use original sources ?
* did you modify some parts ?
* etc.

If relevevant in your domain, you should also provide a new standardized
description of the work.


# Results

Results should be compared with original results and you have to explain why
you think they are the same or why they may differ (qualitative result vs
quantitative result). Note that it is not necessary to redo all the original
analysis of the results.


# Conclusion

Conclusion, at the very minimum, should indicate very clearly if you were able
to replicate original results. If it was not possible but you found the reason
why (error in the original results), you should exlain it.
