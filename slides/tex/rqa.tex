$\mathbf{R}^{m}_{i,j} (\epsilon)$ is two dimensional plot of $N \times N$ square matrix
defined by

%%********************************[EQUATION]************************************
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}^{m}_{i,j} (\epsilon) = 
\Theta ( \epsilon_i - || X(i) - X(j) || ), \quad X(i) \in \mathbb{R}^m, \quad i,j=1,\dots,N
\end{equation}

%%********************************[EQUATION]************************************
where $N$ is the number of cosidered states of $X(i)$, 
$\epsilon$ is a theshold distance, 
$ || \dot ||$ a norm, and $\Theta( \dot )$ is the Heaviside function.

\begin{description}
\item [ \textbf{REC} ] enumerates the black dots in the RP.
\item [ \textbf{DET} ] fraction of recurrence points that form diagonal lines. \\
			\textit{(interpreted as the predictibility where, for example,
				periodic signals show longer diagonal lines 
				than chaotic ones.
				)}
\item [ \textbf{RATIO} ] is the radio of DET to REC. \\
			\textit{(useful to discover dynamic transitions)}.
\item [ \textbf{LAM} ] computes the recurrence points in the vertical lines \\
			\textit{(analogous to DET)}.
