\begin{itemize}
	\item (+) Quantification for Arm Movement and Head Pose Estimation Variability with Nonlinear Dynamics is possible. However,
	\item (-) the timeseries from the landmarks are mounted on the pose location of the head. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Test other techniques of Nonlinear Dynamics, e.g. Lyapunov Exponents, Recurrent Quantification Analysis
	\item Use of Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic identification of Movement Variability
\end{itemize}
